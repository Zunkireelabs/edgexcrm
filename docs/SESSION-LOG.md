## Phase 2A — SaaS Operational Layer (February 21, 2026)

### What Was Built

Built the full operational layer: lead assignment, counselor role, dual-mode pipeline stages, invite system, checklists, and intake tracking. All backend/API — no UI changes (that's Phase 2B).

#### 1. Database Migration (`003_phase2a_saas_ops.sql`)
- **`stage_id`** on leads — FK to `pipeline_stages`, backfilled from `status` slug for all 10 existing leads
- **`assigned_to`** on leads — FK to `auth.users`, indexed where `deleted_at IS NULL`
- **Intake fields** — `intake_source`, `intake_medium`, `intake_campaign`, `preferred_contact_method`
- **Counselor role** — expanded `tenant_users` check constraint to include `'counselor'`
- **`invite_tokens` table** — email, role, token, expiry, RLS for admin-only SELECT
- **`lead_checklists` table** — per-lead checklist items with position, completion tracking, RLS for tenant members
- **`get_user_tenant_role()`** — SECURITY DEFINER helper function

#### 2. Type System Updates (`src/types/database.ts`)
- `UserRole` union: added `"counselor"`
- `Lead.status`: changed from `LeadStatus` to `string` (pipeline stages are dynamic)
- `Lead` interface: added `stage_id`, `assigned_to`, intake fields
- New interfaces: `InviteToken`, `LeadChecklist`
- `LeadStatus` type kept for backward compat (dashboard color maps)

#### 3. Auth Layer (`src/lib/api/auth.ts`)
- **`authenticateUser()`** — lightweight JWT-only auth, no tenant required (for invite accept flow)
- **`requireLeadAccess(auth, lead)`** — admin OR (counselor AND assigned_to match)
- **`isCounselorOrAbove(auth)`** — owner, admin, or counselor (distinguishes from viewer)

#### 4. Validation (`src/lib/api/validation.ts`)
- **`optionalMaxLength(n)`** — returns null if empty, else checks length

#### 5. Queries (`src/lib/supabase/queries.ts`)
- `getCurrentUserTenant()` — now returns `userId` alongside tenant/role
- `getLeads()` — accepts optional `{ role, userId }` for counselor scoping
- `getLead()` — same counselor scoping
- `getLeadChecklists()` — new, ordered by position

#### 6. Updated Leads API (`src/app/api/v1/leads/`)

**GET /api/v1/leads**:
- `assigned_to` query param filter
- Counselor auto-scoping: forces `assigned_to = auth.userId`

**POST /api/v1/leads**:
- Accepts intake fields
- Always resolves `stage_id` from status slug — rejects 422 if no matching stage
- No lead can be created with `stage_id = NULL`

**GET /api/v1/leads/[id]**:
- Counselor scoping: 404 if not assigned

**PATCH /api/v1/leads/[id]**:
- Access: `requireLeadAccess()` replaces `requireAdmin()`
- `ADMIN_ONLY_FIELDS = ["assigned_to"]` — counselor submitting → 403
- Dual-mode stage resolution:
  - `status` only → resolves `stage_id` from pipeline_stages
  - `stage_id` only → resolves `status` slug from pipeline_stages
  - Both → 422
- `assigned_to` validation: must be tenant member, checked on every PATCH
- Emits `lead.assigned` event on assignment change

**DELETE**: unchanged (admin only)

#### 7. Invite API (`src/app/api/v1/invites/`)

**POST /api/v1/invites** (admin only):
- Creates invite with 7-day expiry, crypto.randomUUID() token
- Checks: no existing member, no pending invite for same email

**GET /api/v1/invites** (admin only):
- Returns pending (unaccepted, unexpired) invites

**POST /api/v1/invites/accept** (authenticated, no tenant required):
- Uses `authenticateUser()` — user may not have a tenant yet
- Validates: token exists, not expired, email matches JWT, not already member
- Creates `tenant_users` record, marks invite accepted

**DELETE /api/v1/invites/[id]** (admin only):
- Hard deletes invite

#### 8. Checklist API (`src/app/api/v1/leads/[id]/checklists/`)

**GET** (lead-access scoped):
- Returns checklists ordered by position
- 404 if lead is soft-deleted

**POST** (admin only):
- Creates checklist item with title, position

**PATCH /checklists/[checklistId]** (lead-access scoped):
- Counselor: can only toggle `is_completed`
- Admin: can also update `title`, `position`
- Auto-sets `completed_at`/`completed_by` on completion, clears on uncompletion

**DELETE** (admin only):
- Hard deletes checklist item

#### 9. Dashboard Pages
- `dashboard/page.tsx`, `leads/page.tsx`, `leads/[id]/page.tsx` — pass `role`/`userId` for counselor scoping
- `lead-detail.tsx`, `leads-table.tsx` — fixed `statusColors` typing from `Record<LeadStatus, string>` to `Record<string, string>` for dynamic stages

### Verification Results — 39/39 PASS

| Section | Tests | Result |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Migration | 7 | ✅ All pass — backfill, tables, RLS, constraints, function |
| Counselor Isolation | 5 | ✅ All pass — B can't see/get/patch A's leads, A can, admin sees all |
| Assignment Validation | 3 | ✅ All pass — non-member→422, viewer→allowed, counselor reassign→403 |
| Invite Flow | 5 | ✅ All pass — create, accept, re-accept→422, expired→422, existing member→409 |
| Checklist Security | 7 | ✅ All pass — admin create, counselor toggle, counselor can't edit title, viewer blocked, soft-delete→404 |
| Stage Integrity | 5 | ✅ All pass — invalid stage→422, invalid slug→422, both→422, 5 transitions consistent, stage_id→status |
| Regression | 5 | ✅ All pass — public form, rate limiting, audit logs, events, intake fields |
| Build | 3 | ✅ All pass — npm build, no TS warnings, Docker build |

### Files Changed

**New (7):**
- `supabase/migrations/003_phase2a_saas_ops.sql`
- `src/app/api/v1/invites/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/invites/accept/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/invites/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/leads/[id]/checklists/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/leads/[id]/checklists/[checklistId]/route.ts`
- `scripts/verify-phase2a.sh` (test script)

**Modified (9):**
- `src/types/database.ts`
- `src/lib/api/auth.ts`
- `src/lib/api/validation.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase/queries.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/leads/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/leads/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/leads/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/leads/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/lead-detail.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/leads-table.tsx`

### Design Decisions

1. **`assigned_to` allows any tenant member (including viewer)** — assignment is informational tracking, not access control. A viewer assigned to a lead can see it but can't modify it.
2. **Counselor gets 403 on PATCH (not 404)** when trying to update non-assigned lead fields — the lead exists (they passed access check for the lead itself), but the specific field is admin-only.
3. **`authenticateUser()` is separate from `authenticateRequest()`** — invite accept flow needs JWT validation without tenant membership (user has no tenant yet).
4. **Hard delete for invites and checklists** — these are operational data, not business records. No soft-delete needed.
5. **`stage_id` always resolved on POST** — enforces pipeline integrity from day one. No NULL `stage_id` on any new lead.

## Phase 1.5 — API-First Architecture (February 20–21, 2026)

### What Was Built
- RESTful API routes at `/api/v1/leads` and `/api/v1/leads/[id]` with full CRUD
- Pagination, search, status filter on GET
- Idempotency key support on POST (prevents duplicate leads)
- Soft deletes (`deleted_at` column) instead of hard deletes
- Audit trail (`audit_logs` table) — logs all mutations with changes diff
- Event system (`events` table) — emits `lead.created`, `lead.updated`, `lead.status_changed`, `lead.deleted`
- Pipeline stages (`pipeline_stages` table) — configurable per tenant, seeded with 5 defaults
- Status validation against pipeline stages (PATCH rejects invalid status slugs)
- Rate limiting on public form POST (in-memory, per tenant+IP)
- Structured logging via pino
- API response helpers (apiSuccess, apiError, apiPaginated, etc.)
- Request authentication via Supabase SSR cookies

### Migration: `002_phase1_5_foundation.sql`
- Added `deleted_at`, `idempotency_key` to leads
- Created `audit_logs`, `events`, `pipeline_stages` tables
- Seeded 5 default stages per tenant: new, partial, contacted, enrolled, rejected
- RLS on all new tables

## Phase 1 — Initial Build (February 20, 2026)

### What Was Built
Converted the single-client RKU scholarship lead system into a scalable multi-tenant SaaS product.

### Source Project
- **Location**: `/home/zunkireelabs/devprojects/hardik-dev-space/rku-dev/rku-form-prep/`
- **What it was**: Static HTML/JS scholarship form + admin dashboard for RK University
- **Backend**: Supabase (project ref: `ldsgsdjixzsljgkcktqu`)
- **Dashboard**: `leads-admin.zunkireelabs.com` (still running on Docker)

### Architecture
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Docker + Traefik deployment
- 5 tables with RLS using SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Dynamic multi-step public forms rendered from JSONB config
- Dashboard with stats, leads table, lead detail, settings

### Issues Fixed
1. **Docker SIGBUS** — .dockerignore + Node 22 + increased memory
2. **DNS mismatch** — `lead-crm` vs `leads-crm`
3. **Healthcheck** — `wget` to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
4. **RLS infinite recursion** — SECURITY DEFINER functions
5. **Public form 404** — anon SELECT policy on tenants
6. **Dashboard redirect loop** — show error instead of redirect

## Adding a New Client (Tenant)

```sql
-- 1. Create tenant
INSERT INTO tenants (name, slug, primary_color, config)
VALUES ('Client Name', 'client-slug', '#1a73e8', '{}');

-- 2. Create Supabase auth user (via API or dashboard)
-- Then link them:
INSERT INTO tenant_users (tenant_id, user_id, role)
VALUES ('<tenant-id>', '<auth-user-id>', 'owner');

-- 3. Create form config
INSERT INTO form_configs (tenant_id, name, is_active, branding, steps)
VALUES ('<tenant-id>', 'Lead Form', true,
  '{"title": "Apply Now", "primary_color": "#1a73e8"}'::jsonb,
  '[{"title": "Contact Info", "fields": [...]}]'::jsonb
);

-- 4. Pipeline stages auto-seeded (trigger in 002 migration)
-- 5. Form is live at: https://lead-crm.zunkireelabs.com/form/client-slug
```

### Adding a User via Invite (Phase 2A)

```bash
# Admin creates invite via API
curl -X POST https://lead-crm.zunkireelabs.com/api/v1/invites \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: <admin-session-cookie>" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","role":"counselor"}'

# Response includes token — share with user
# User signs up in Supabase, then accepts:
curl -X POST https://lead-crm.zunkireelabs.com/api/v1/invites/accept \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: <user-session-cookie>" \
  -d '{"token":"<invite-token>"}'
```
